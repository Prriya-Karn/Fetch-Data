"In the course of developing this project, I acquired proficiency in utilizing React hooks such as useState and useEffect. 
Additionally, I gained a comprehensive understanding of asynchronous operations and implemented the async/await pattern for fetching data.
My knowledge extends to the practical application of data retrieval from external APIs, 
contributing to the project's capability to seamlessly integrate and display real-time information."
